To (re)compile to pdf just run `make`

Prerequisites:
--------------
Had no luck with the docker approach in the base repo, so install latex locally (it is a cool soft anyway).  
To install latex+packages run `install_latex.sh`  
It installs minimal latex basictex plus some packages used in this proj.  
And additionally something else ) took it from Jupiter notebook guys
